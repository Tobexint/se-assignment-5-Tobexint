10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
    Answer:
      - Step 1: Install Git
Before using Git in VS Code, ensure that Git is installed on your system:

Windows: Download and install Git from git-scm.com.
macOS: Install Git using Homebrew (brew install git) or download from git-scm.com.
Linux: Install Git using your package manager (sudo apt-get install git for Debian-based distributions, sudo yum install git for Red Hat-based distributions).
Step 2: Configure Git
Open a terminal in VS Code (use the integrated terminal with `Ctrl+``) and configure your Git username and email:

bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
Step 3: Initialize a Git Repository
Open Your Project Folder:

Open VS Code.
Open your project folder by selecting File > Open Folder and navigating to your project directory.
Initialize Git Repository:

Open the Source Control view by clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar or using the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+G.
Click the Initialize Repository button. This will create a .git folder in your project directory, setting up a new Git repository.
Step 4: Making Commits
Staging Changes:

In the Source Control view, you’ll see a list of files with changes. Click the + icon next to each file to stage it.
To stage all changes, click the + icon next to Changes or use the command palette with Ctrl+Shift+P and type Git: Stage All Changes.
Committing Changes:

Once changes are staged, enter a commit message in the text box at the top of the Source Control view.
Click the checkmark icon or press Ctrl+Enter to commit the staged changes.
Step 5: Connecting to GitHub
Creating a GitHub Repository:

Go to GitHub and create a new repository (click the + icon in the upper-right corner and select New repository).
Copy the repository URL (HTTPS or SSH).
Adding Remote Repository:

In the terminal, add the GitHub repository as a remote origin:
bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
If using SSH, the command will be:
bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/your-repository.git
Step 6: Pushing Changes to GitHub
Push Initial Commit:

Push your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub:
bash
git push -u origin main
If your default branch is master instead of main, use:
bash
git push -u origin master
Pushing Subsequent Changes:

After making additional commits, push changes with:
bash
git push
Additional Git Features in VS Code
Branch Management:

Create, switch, and manage branches using the Source Control view or the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P > Git: Create Branch, Git: Checkout to, etc.).
Merging and Rebasing:

Perform merge and rebase operations using the Command Palette or terminal commands (git merge, git rebase).
Viewing History and Diffs:

View commit history and diffs by right-clicking files and selecting View File History or View Line History.
Resolving Conflicts:

When merge conflicts occur, VS Code provides a user-friendly interface to resolve them. Conflicted files will appear in the Source Control view with options to accept current changes, incoming changes, or both.
